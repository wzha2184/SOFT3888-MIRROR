We may have some knowledge of Elixir at that time and can have a look and play with that firmware. It is said that we can login through the provided VPN.
  -	Cian also showed us the repo of what was done by the team of last semester which did the similar thing(mainly the `GPU monitor`), and the repo has already been sent in Discord chat. At the tutorial this week we may have a look at it.
