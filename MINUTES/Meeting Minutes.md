- `problems/in progress`
    - Jason tried to login the virtual machine provided by the client but failed. So this is conveyed to our client and they reset the user name of the account and now it is usable.
    - We showed our client our updated database design which used 3 tables to hold data of CPU, GPU and BIOS, using the timestamp as the primary key. Cian gave us feedback that we need to consider that there are multiple GPUs and we might further use the combination of both timestamp and the GPU id as the primary key.
    - As for the first client deployment, we are required to first make sure that the Elixir server is able to be run on the virtual machine provided by our client. And after that we will book for the deployment on Monday and choose a time between Tuesday and Wednesday next week.

    - Make sure that the Elixir server is able to run on the virtual machine
